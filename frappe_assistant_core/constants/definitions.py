‚ö° AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT:
The server detects substantial analysis results and enforces artifact streaming by:
- Providing summary and redirection when large results detected
- Requiring re-execution in artifact workspace for complete results
- Ensuring unlimited analysis depth through artifact streaming

üéØ ARTIFACT STREAMING TRIGGERS:

- Analysis tools: enforce_artifact_streaming = {streaming_manager.should_enforce_streaming()}
- Response limit prevention: {streaming_manager.should_prevent_response_limits()}

‚úÖ BENEFITS OF CONFIGURED APPROACH:
- Eliminates response limit errors completely
- Professional deliverable creation guaranteed
- Unlimited analytical depth ensured
- Stakeholder-ready outputs automatic
